## Part 1 - The Idea

The link below connects to part one of my final project. This section concentrates on the initial high level summary and outline of the project, the data sources, and the planned approach.

## Part 2 - Design and User Research

The link below connects to part two of my final project. The second part of the porject shows the initial view of some visualizations and layout. I also completed user research in this section by having a few people look at the story and incorporating their feedback.

## Part 3 - The Final Story

### Intended Audience
The intended audience for my final data story is residents in Pennsylvania. I picked Pennsylvania because I am going to school in the state, so it made the project more relatable for me and people I interact with on a daily basis. I also wanted to know how I personally could help prevent food insecurity for my neighbors.

This decision to concentrate on Pennsylvania really helped my focus the story. In the beginning of the project, I had so much data and it was all at the full United States picture. While this information is informative and shows support for a cause, it makes it much harder to connect with a specific audience. To work on connecting with my audience, I start the story at a very high level by sharing some high level statistics, such as total estimated population of hungry people in the USA. I then continue at the USA level by showing it is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and sharing maps showing income and environmental food index by county for the United States. I then dig into the PA maps showing income, overall food insecurity and childhood insecurity. Finally, I continue with a scatterplot based on PA data. I used the method of starting large to introduce the topic and then connecting with the audience more by looking at the state they live in.

### Summary
At this point, the final story is put together for the project. I defintiely changed some direction from part one, where I mined a ton of data on income, food environmental index, and obesity rates for all counties in the United States. My original thought was to research how low income areas tend to have less healthy options leading to both obesity and food insecurity. That idea was a bit too broad, so I eventually decided to just concentrate on income and food insecurity.

I then build a few graphs on the data at a USA level before I decided to drill down into Pennsylvania further to allow for a more relatable story. This caused me to pull in a few additional data points, and allowed me to complete my call to action for charities that help in the Pennsylvania area. The story still had a ton of visualizations and information, so I further trimmed it down a bit by concentrating on the relationship of income and childhood food insecurity in the final graph instead of showing graphs on both overall and childhood insecurity.

I learned to make sure I do not overwhelm the audience with too much information and visualizations. I wanted to provide a ton of information to back my cause. However, that can be distracting and make it harder to tell the audience on cohesive story. It was very difficult for me to remove graphs in each iteration of trimming the scope. I will have to keep this in mind in the future by keeping the story simple, and remembering more does not always equate to better and clearer.
