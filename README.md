## Part 3 - The Final Story

The intended audience for my final data story is 

A few paragraphs that talk about the intended audience for your final data story.  Include any personas and / or other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus.  Talk about specific things you did to your final project to make it work for your audience. 

A few paragraphs that summarize the work you've done so far.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)
